        <h2>Food Insecurity in Syracuse, New York</h2>
        <p>
            According to the United States Department of Agriculture, food insecurity is a “household-level 
            economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food” (Coleman-Jensen, 2022). 
            Poverty is directly related to food insecurity because lack of money limits access to adequate food, thus 
            individuals living in poverty are more likely to be food insecure. In Syracuse, New York, there is a very 
            high percentage of children who are considered living in poverty; therefore, many children in our local 
            community are also living with food insecurity.<br><br>
            Did you know, in 2016, the Syracuse City School District had 20,750 enrolled students, 100% of which 
            qualified for the Free and Reduced-Price (F/RP) school meals. On average each school day, 11,275 or 
            54.34% of students eat F/RP school breakfast (Pino-Goodspeed, n.d., p.1). This is a striking percentage. 
            The data from Mapping the Food Environment in Syracuse, New York indicates that 50% of children in 
            Syracuse are living in poverty (Onondaga County Health Department, 2017, p.7). Additionally, according 
            to the Onondaga County Community Health Assessment and Improvement Plan (2019-2021) “50.9% of 
            census tracts in Syracuse are food deserts” (Volz, n.d., p.27). <br><br>
            These numbers may be a little outdated, but it helps express the severity of food insecurity in the 
            community, which is something we don’t talk enough about on campus. Although Syracuse students 
            might not consider Syracuse their permanent home, we still have a responsibility to give back to our 
            local community, especially when our five dining halls close every night with a surplus of food that totals 
            to pounds and pounds of waste when children not much younger than us aren’t sure where their next 
            meal is coming from.
        </p>
        <h2>For these reasons, I have dedicated this page to resources about how to give back to the Syracuse and 
            CNY communities to help fight food insecurity and food waste:</h2>

                    “The Food Recovery Network has the dual mission of feeding people and reducing food waste. The 
                    ESF/SU Food Recovery Network is one of the largest chapters of FRN in the U.S. Student volunteers 
                    conduct daily recoveries to get surplus food to community members in need. During the Spring 2021 
                    academic year, the ESF/ SU FRN recovered over 7 tons of food from dining halls. There are around 20 
                    weekly recoveries that volunteers can participate in, and students can volunteer as much or as little as 
                    they please. FRN strives to improve the betterment of our Syracuse community, while providing our 
                    members with valuable volunteer experience and awareness about sustainability and food waste.”
