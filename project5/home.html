    <h2>Who is the Chef behind Cuse Cooks?</h2>

    <p>
        Hi, I’m Ari! I am a senior at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology with 
        a concentration in Web Design and minor in Public Communications.
    </p>
    <p>
        My biggest passion in life is food.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the last year and a half, I had two amazing opportunities to spend time abroad which has 
        strengthened my love for cookie, baking, and eating while expanding my palette across various cuisines.
        I spent the summer between my sophomore and junior year in Tel Aviv, Israel while interning for a food
        touring company. This spring I spent the semester studying abroad in Florence, Italy, and had the 
        opportunity to travel to 11 different countries. A a passionate foodie, I was determined to experience
        different cultures through food. Every place I visited, I sought after their most popular dish: schnitzel in 
        Austria, paella in Spain, Bolognese in Italy… you get the idea! Bascially, I love food, and I want to share 
        that with you!
